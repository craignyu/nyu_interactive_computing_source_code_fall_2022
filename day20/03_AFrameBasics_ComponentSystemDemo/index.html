    	<!--
	       The 'a-assets' container is used to load in any external artwork you may want to use as "textures" for your objects.
	       Ensure that this element has an ID of 'VRAssets'

	       Textures can be loaded by creating a new 'img' tag inside of the 'a-assets' container.
	       When doing this you will need to make sure to give your textures a unique ID -
	       this will be used by p5 to create new objects.

	       Example:

	       <img id="ITEM_ID_GOES_HERE" src="images/gold_block.png">
		-->

			<a-assets id="VRAssets">
		  		<img id="gold_block" src="../images/gold_block.png" />
		  		<img id="stonebrick" src="../images/stonebrick.png" />
			</a-assets>


		  <!-- the a-entity tag lets you define a 3D entity
		       entities have the following attributes (and many more!):

		       geometry: the geometric properties that describe the object (box, plane, sphere, etc) along with width, height, depth information
		       material: the "skin" of the object - color, image texture, etc
		       position: where the entity is oriented in the 3D world (x, y and z position)
		       rotation: how the object is rotated (xRotation, yRotation, zRotation)
		  -->

		  <!-- a big plane that will serve as a "floor" for our world -->
		  <a-entity geometry="primitive: plane; width: 100; height: 100;" material="src: #stonebrick; repeat: 100 100" position="0 0 0" rotation="-90 0 0"></a-entity>

      <!-- some cubes in front of the user
			     we will apply the 'spinner' component to these entities so that they
					 use the custom component we wrote above -->
      <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width:1; height: 1; depth: 1" material="color: rgb(255,255,0)" position="0 0.5 -5" rotation="0 0 0" spinner></a-entity>
